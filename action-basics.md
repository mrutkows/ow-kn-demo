# Creating and Invoking Actions

## Creating Actions - Helloworld

Review the following steps and examples to create your first JavaScript action.

1. Create a JavaScript file with the following content. For this example, the file name is 'hello.js'.

   ```javascript
   function main() {
       return {payload: 'Hello world'};
   }
   ```

   The JavaScript file might contain additional functions. However, by convention, a function called `main` is the default entry point for the action.

   ### Takeaways

   - No special code needed, just the language

2. Create an action from the following JavaScript function. For this example, the action is called `hello`.

   ```bash
   ic fn action create hello ~/hello.js
   ```

   ```text
   ok: created action hello
   ```

3. List the actions that you have created:

   ```bash
   ic fn action list
   ```

   ```text
   actions
   <NAMESPACE>/hello       private    nodejs10
   ```

   You can see the `hello` action you just created under your default NAMESPACE with implied access control provided by the platform.

## Invoking Actions

After you create your action, you can run it on IBM Cloud Functions with the `invoke` command using one of two modes:

- **blocking** - which will _**wait**_ for the result \(i.e., request/response style\) by specifying the `blocking` flag on the command-line.
- **non-blocking** - which will invoke the action immediately, but _**not wait**_ for a response.

Regardless, invocations always provide an **Activation ID** which can be used later to lookup the action's response.

### Blocking Invocations

A blocking invocation request will _wait_ for the activation result to be available.

The wait period is the lesser of 60 seconds or the action's configured [time limit](https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk/blob/master/docs/reference.md#per-action-timeout-ms-default-60s).

1. Invoke the `hello` action using the command-line as a blocking activation.

  ```bash
  ic fn action invoke --blocking hello
  ```

  The command outputs the **Activation ID** (`44794bd6aab74415b4e42a308d880e5b`) which can always be used later to lookup the response:

  ```bash
  ok: invoked /_/hello with id 44794bd6aab74415b4e42a308d880e5b
  ```

  and the complete **Activation record** in JSON format which contains all information about the activation including the function's complete `response`. The JavaScript function's output is the string `Hello world` which appears as the value of the `payload` key:

  ```json
  ...
  "response": {
        "result": {
            "payload": "Hello world"
        },
        "size": 25,
        "status": "success",
        "success": true
    },
    ...
  ```

### Non-blocking invocations

A non-blocking invocation will invoke the action immediately, but _not wait_ for a response.

If you don't need the action result right away, you can omit the `--blocking` flag to make a non-blocking invocation. You can get the result later by using the **Activation ID**.

1. Invoke the `hello` Action using the command-line as a non-blocking activation.

   ```bash
   ibmcloud fn action invoke hello
   ```

   ```bash
   ok: invoked /_/hello with id 6bf1f670ee614a7eb5af3c9fde813043
   ```

2. Retrieve the activation result

   ```bash
   ibmcloud fn activation result 6bf1f670ee614a7eb5af3c9fde81304
   ```

   ```json
   {
       "payload": "Hello world"
   }
   ```

## Retrieve the last activation result

To access the most recent activation result use the `--last` or `-l` flag.

1. Run the following command to get your last activation result.

  ```bash
  ibmcloud fn activation result --last
  ```

  ```json
  {
      "payload": "Hello world"
  }
  ```

  {% hint style="warning" %}
  _Do not use an activation ID with the flag `--last`._
  {% endhint %}

## Retrieve the full activation record

  1. To get the complete activation record use the `activation get` command:

  ```bash
  ibmcloud fn activation get 6bf1f670ee614a7eb5af3c9fde813043
  ```

  ```json
  ok: got activation 6bf1f670ee614a7eb5af3c9fde813043
  {
    ...
    "response": {
        "result": {
            "payload": "Hello world"
        },
        "size": 25,
        "status": "success",
        "success": true
    },
    ...
  }
  ```

  {% hint style="info" %}
  **Tip** The `--last` flag can also be used to get the last activation record (`activation get --last`), from the activation logs.
  {% endhint %}

## Retrieve activation list

1. If you forget to record the activation ID, you can get a list of activations ordered from the most recent to the oldest. Run the following command to get a list of your activations:

```bash
ibmcloud fn activation list
```

```bash
Datetime   Activation ID  Kind      Start Duration Status  Entity
y:m:d:hm:s 44794bd6...    nodejs:10 cold  34s      success <NAMESPACE>/hello:0.0.1
y:m:d:hm:s 6bf1f670...    nodejs:10 warm  2ms      success <NAMESPACE>/hello:0.0.1
```

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note** The **`Entity`** column indicates which action was invoked along with the function's internal version. Every time you update an action's code, the platform will increment the internal version number.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
ðŸŽ‰ **Great work!** You have now learned how to create, deploy and invoke your own serverless functions on IBM Cloud Functions. What about passing data into actions? Let's find out more...
