# OpenWhisk - Knative Functions WG demo

## OpenWhisk Approach

### Developer-centric

- Everything we do is **Developer simplicity**

  - Developer only codes functions in their chosen language
     - _No directives | pragmas | annotations_
     - Utilize normal language module/package imports
        - May provide platform callbacks/intrinsic functionality (as functions)
  - Developer has NO knowledge of
     - OS
     - Platform (implementation)
        - _Kube | knative | Pfirecracker, etc._
     - Service Framework


###
